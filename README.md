# MBTA Subway Map Data API

This project provides a simple REST API that exposes subway stop data for the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority). It returns GPS coordinates, associated subway lines, and adjacent stops for each station on the light and heavy rail network.

## Features

- Real-time data fetched from the MBTA public API
- Built using **FastAPI** for easy documentation and fast performance
- Exposes one endpoint: `/stops`
- Includes logic for calculating **adjacent stops** based on train stops
- JSON output includes:
  - Stop name
  - stop_id
  - Coordinates (latitude/longitude)
  - Subway lines
  - Adjacent stops and the lines they are connected by

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vincentsking/mtba_subway_stops_map_data.git
cd mbta-subway-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## API Endpoint

### `GET /stops`

Returns a list of MBTA subway stops with:
- Name
- Coordinates
- Lines (Red, Orange, Blue, Green)
- Adjacent stops and the lines connecting them

Example:
```json
{
    "stop_name": "Downtown Crossing",
    "stop_id": "place-dwnxg",
    "coordinates": {
      "latitude": 42.355518,
      "longitude": -71.060225
    },
    "lines": [
      "Orange",
      "Red"
    ],
    "adjacent_stops": [
      {
        "stop_id": "place-pktrm",
        "stop_name": "Park Street",
        "lines": [
          "Green-C",
          "Green-B",
          "Red",
          "Green-E",
          "Green-D"
        ]
      },
      {
        "stop_id": "place-sstat",
        "stop_name": "South Station",
        "lines": [
          "Red"
        ]
      },
      {
        "stop_id": "place-chncl",
        "stop_name": "Chinatown",
        "lines": [
          "Orange"
        ]
      },
      {
        "stop_id": "place-state",
        "stop_name": "State",
        "lines": [
          "Orange",
          "Blue"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

## Design Decisions
### Notes on Development Approach

I initially gave this challenge to ChatGPT out of curiosity and to potentially accelerate the early stages of the project. Its example served as a decent starting point and did help get things off the ground quickly. The use of **Uvicorn** for hot-reloading was especially helpful during development â€” every time you save the file, the service restarts automatically, which made iterating fast and smooth.

At first glance, the results looked promising. However, as I dug deeper, several flaws became clear:

* **Limited coverage of subway lines**: The app only completed a small portion of one subway line. It turned out that the MBTA API was returning `429 Too Many Requests` responses after the rate limit was hit, but these were silently ignored. As a result, many stops were skipped without warning.

* **Insufficient error handling**: The original solution lacked robustness. There was no proper retry logic, and exceptions weren't caught or logged, making debugging difficult.

* **Lack of modularity and reuse**: The code structure made it difficult to test individual components or adapt the logic without heavy duplication.

* **Missing logging**: Iterating without debug logs slowed down progress. I added much more granular logging to help visualize what the app was doing at each step.

To address these issues, I created a generic `make_a_request(url)` function that wraps `requests.get()` and checks for valid return codes. If a `429` is received, it extracts the `x-ratelimit-reset` value from the headers, waits the required amount of time, and retries the request.

I also discovered that both the **Red Line** and **Mattapan Line** lacked proper `stop_sequence` values from the `/schedules` endpoint. After some research, I found this is a known issue with the MBTA API â€” likely stemming from their backend data, not the API layer itself.

The original approach attempted to derive stop sequences by pulling trip schedules and sorting them by `stop_sequence`, which made sense in theory. However, in practice, the stop IDs retrieved from the `relationships.stop.data.id` field in the schedule API **did not match** the IDs returned from the `/stops` API. This mismatch caused major problems with the `adjacent_stops` logic and led to duplicated stops that didnâ€™t include all expected lines.

For reference, I kept ChatGPT's original code in the repo under `ai_orig.py`, but ended up scrapping most of it in favor of a more simple, reliable and testable solution.

### Limitations

While the current version of the program is functional, several limitations exist:

2. **No Persistent Caching**

   * Each request to the API fetches fresh data without caching. This can lead to slower performance and unnecessary load on the MBTA API.

3. **Limited Error Handling**

   * The current error handling is minimal and may not gracefully recover from all failure modes, such as network timeouts, invalid API responses, or missing fields.

4. **No Frontend Interface**

   * There is no graphical or web-based user interface. Data is returned in raw JSON format, which may not be user-friendly for non-technical users.

5. **Hardcoded API Parameters**

   * Some aspects of the request behavior may be hardcoded, limiting flexibility for filtering, sorting, or interacting dynamically with different endpoints.

6. **Not Production-Hardened**

   * The program lacks features like authentication, rate limiting, logging, and deployment configuration that would be expected in a production-grade service.

7. **No Formal Test Coverage**

   * While the code may be manually tested, automated unit or integration tests are currently limited or absent.

### Future Improvements

If I were to continue working on this program, I would focus on the following enhancements:

1. **Expand API Functionality**

   * Add additional endpoints to support filtering by route, direction, or schedule time.
   * Provide real-time subway updates by integrating with MBTAâ€™s live data feeds.

2. **Introduce Caching**

   * Use in-memory caching (e.g., `functools.lru_cache` or `cachetools`) to minimize redundant MBTA API requests.
   * Consider Redis or other backends for scalable, persistent caching.

3. **Optimize Deployment**

   * Package the app with Docker for reproducible environments.
   * Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar to automate testing and deployment.

4. **Improve Documentation and Setup**

   * Expand the README with usage examples and troubleshooting tips.
   * Provide a setup script using `pyenv`, `pipenv` for consistent Python environment management.

5. **Frontend Visualization**

   * Build a simple web frontend to visualize subway stops and live updates on a map

These improvements would make the program more reliable, maintainable, and user-friendlyâ€”while paving the way for broader usage and contributions.
